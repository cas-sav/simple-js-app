Simple Js App - Pokedex App

This app organizes Pokemon information. It displays the name of Pokemons and when clicked opens a modal that allows for the user to see that Pokemons specificed details. The details include Name, Height, Weight, Types, and Abilities. 

When creating this app I learned some of the basics of JavaScript and how it can be used in a real-world situation.
